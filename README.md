# new_hsk_scraping
I scraped all new chinese HSK level 1-9 words from pandarin.net by the help of BeautifulSoup.
Afterwards I saved it as JSON Dictionary with ID as Key and as CSV-Table.
Thereafter I created manually an Excel out of the CSV-file.
For any feedback or questions, don't hesitate to contact me "davidschmid121186@gmail.com".
